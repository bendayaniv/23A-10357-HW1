## A little review:
In this game you need to avoid the obstacles (the birds) with the player (the plane).
In this current time the game is endless - even though the player lost his all lifes, he can continue to play.


## How to play: 
You can't move forward, only to right or left.


## Later in the project 
We will add prize object that will give score to the player, and save records in a 'List of Records'.
